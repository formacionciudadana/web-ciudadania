abstract = "Large scale international studies focus a great deal on measuring knowledge as academic achievement, leaving sidelined the study of students, parents and teachers’ attitudes. In the case of the International Civic and Citizenship Education Study (ICCS 2009), along with  civic knowledge there are a series of relevant instruments for measuring citizenship related concepts as attitudes, beliefs and behavior. In order to facilitate and estimulate the use of these questionnaires, this database incorporates variables constructed on the basis of compound indices (estimated with IRT) of those scales that address the same topic, such as trust in institutions, participation, school climate, attitudes towards minorities and ethnic groups, among others. Many times these variables are used as they come in the database, without stopping to analyze or problematize the validity of these measurements and their consequences in terms of analysis and contrast of hypotheses. Using as an example the scale of attitudes regarding equality of rights between men and women, this chapter begins by describing in general terms the characteristics of ICCS and then implements factor analyzes that show the possible problems of validity that can lead to the use of the ICCS proposed scores.The implications in terms of validity are addressed in the conclusions."
